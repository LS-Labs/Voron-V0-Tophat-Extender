# Voron-V0-Tophat-Extender

Remixed from this original [top hat extender by 93djen](https://www.printables.com/model/109713-voron-v01-tophat-spacer-with-hinges)

Why do You need a Top Hat spacer I hear you ask?

we noticed the umbilical and bowden would push on the lid when the tool head was at the rear of the printer, causing ever so slight movement in the nozzle causing inconsistent prints are the rear of the bed, wo we decided to use Top Hat spacers, and liking the work 93djen had already done we made a few improvements, modifications and bling.

To date we have:

Reversed the angle of the led channel so the light shines down. 
Transparent PETG lenses for led diffusion.
fits both 0.1 and 0.2 so we can keep the pretty printed top hat, on your V0.2
Designed to use the V0.2 Hinges if you want to use them with the V0.1 you will need to either cut your back panel or order a new pair.
improved the alignment to the printer from the original design.
Added hidden wire tunnels for installing LEDs.
Added a front logo panel for added "bling" factor.
Can have an LED Kit with solderless Direct Wire to board headers, using 26 AWG wire head over to LSLabs.co.uk for the Top Hat LED kits

The Diffusers must be printed with clear filaments, I would advise PET-G, the rest can be printed in any colour you like/have to hand.
