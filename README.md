# Voron-V0-Tophat-Extender

Remixed from this original [top hat extender by 93djen](https://www.printables.com/model/109713-voron-v01-tophat-spacer-with-hinges)

Reversed the angle of the led channel so the light shines down. 
Transparent PETG lenses for led diffusion.
Seperated bigger hinges as they tend to split along the join to the tophat extender. connects with 2 x heat set inserts and 2 x M3x8 on each hinge
Internal hidden routing for wires for the led strips. including a single wire passthrough for connecting the led data cable in series

Works on 0.1 and 0.2 so we can keep the pretty printed top hat but get the extra space that the 0.2 gives. 

Glue magnets into the front holes with matching ones on the normal V0 idler top for a nice satisfying click when it closes. 
takes 7 LEDs on each side (using 60LED/m WS2812B LED Strip)
